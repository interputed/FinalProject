# Functional Programming

## C++
C++ did not support functional programming in the past, however starting with C++11, it gains some capabilities. C++ now supports type inference with the auto type which is necessary for functional style. It also added lambda's and functional combinators like map, filter, etc. It should be noted however, that it is still very cumbersome and not well suited for most things you would do with a language like Haskell.
C++ has an advantage over most purely functional languages, in that it allows manual memory management. All of the cool things you can do with pointer manipulation in C++ work with its functional features, which may allow even more creative freedom going forward.

## Python
Python sort of supports functional programming out of the box, but there's a catch. Most of the included functions/libraries for Python are meticulously crafted to work with imperative and object-oriented styles, but not functional. So there may be use cases for each function call that result in potential undesired behavior. With that being said, many use Python as a functional language. I do not however, and am not sure how to well enough to craft a meaningful example.
