# Implementation of listeners and event handlers

## C++
Here's my controversial and/or bad grade response for C++... C++ is capable of event handling system events like key presses and mouse clicks, however, the code to do so without a 3rd party library is more cumbersome than the entirety of this project. So, yes C++ can listen for events and handle them, ancient Chinese can build a wall visible from space, you can deflect a bullet coming at you by shooting it with another bullet. All of these things are possible, but not necessarily worth doing without some useful 3rd party tools.

## Python
Python relies on 3rd party modules for event handlers. So while it's possible to do, the default Python installation does not have this capability. I have chosen not to use an example as you can essentially make any language do anything if we're willing to include library solutions.
