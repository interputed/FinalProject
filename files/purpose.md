# Language Purpose / Genesis

## C++
### Why was the language created?
C++ was created in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup. He wanted to create a 
language that was both efficient and flexible with a syntax similar to C, but 
that also had high-level features for program organization.

### What problems was the language trying to address?
At the time, C was the dominant language but overly difficult to use for large
software projects. C++ was intended to enable classes to allow better code 
organization and reusability while also being nearly as high-performance 
as C. It began life with the name, "C with classes".

### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
C++ was originally built as a replacement for C. It maintains full backward 
compatibility with C, but adds in classes and other features from the Simula 
language. 

## Python
### Why was the language created?
Python was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. It has a design philosophy 
which emphasizes code readability and syntax that allows programmers to express
algorithms with less lines of code.
 
### What problems was the language trying to address?
Mainly Python wanted to be a simple and easy to read language aimed primarily at
UNIX/C hackers. At the time there were not many high-level languages which were 
easy to read and write simple scripted programs. Python is also incredibly 
flexible allowing the use of multiple paradigms.

### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
Python began life as a descendant of the ABC programming language.
