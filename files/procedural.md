# Procedural Programming

## C++
C++ is first and foremost a Procedural language. It is built on and fully supports C, which is compiled directly to assembly, which is always procedural in nature. You can use C++ in 100% procedural programs with no difficulty whatsoever, as it's just as capable as C itself.

## Python
Python also fully supports procedural programming. In fact, I can't think of a language that doesn't other than Java. It's super easy to write programs that completely rely on breaking the problem into smaller functions, and calling those functions from a main function. Classes and programming paradigms are not forced in Python.
