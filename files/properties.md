## C++
### Getters and Setters
While there is a C++ compiler made by Microsoft, which supports the modern practice of automatically creating Get and Set methods for private objects within a class, the standard C++ standard does not support this. Thus, you must write all get and set functions yourself in C++. Usually.

### Backing Variables
Private variables can serve as backing variables in C++. They are protected at compile time from being accessed by any function outside of their containing class.

## Python
### Getters and Setters
In Python, there is no need for get or set functions as there aren't private members of a class. So you can simply change the values directly without ever writing a get or set method.

### Backing Variables
There are also no backing variables necessary! Too easy.
