# Inheritance / Extension

## C++ && Python
C++ and Python both support multiple inheritance. Any class in either languages can extend or inherit the contents of any other class. This is the first feature to go when people create languages that are strictly object-oriented for some reason, but I've never actually figured out why... I should work on that.
