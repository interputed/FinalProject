# Unique Features of the Language

## C++

### Does the language have any particuularly unique features? 
C++ is unique in that it is a fully object-oriented language, but still maintains the high-performance features of C, such as manual memory management and compiling to machine-specific binary code. C++ is also the only language I know of which contains another programming language completely within its syntax (C). This allows you to jump between writing C and C++ code at any part of a program with no major issues.

## Python

### Does the language have any particularly unique features?
Python's biggest unique feature is the ability to write code in whichever paradigm you wish, or none at all. It supports object-oriented, imperative, functional, procedural, and reflective programming paradigms. It isn't immediately clear if a more flexible language even exists!
